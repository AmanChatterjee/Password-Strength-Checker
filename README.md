This Python script checks if your password has been compromised in data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API. It securely hashes your password using SHA-1 and only sends the first five characters of the hash to the API, ensuring your full password is never exposed. The script retrieves a list of hash suffixes from the API and checks if your passwordâ€™s suffix is among them. If found, it displays the number of times the password has appeared in data breaches, helping users determine whether they should change their password. It features a simple command-line interface and ensures security through the k-Anonymity model. To use the script, install the requests library, run python password_checker.py, and enter a password when prompted. If the password has been found in breaches, the script will warn you; otherwise, it will indicate that the password is safe to use. Since security is critical, it is always recommended to choose strong and unique passwords.
